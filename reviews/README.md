# Reviews

This is a **React** project using **Vite** where users can view reviews sequentially or randomly. The app heavily relies on the **useState** hook to manage the review state, and users can navigate through previous and next reviews, or view a random review by clicking a button.

### Features:
- Navigate between previous and next reviews using the "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- View a random review with the "Random" button.
- Uses the `useState` hook to manage the active review state and user interactions.
