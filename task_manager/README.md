# Task Manager
This is a **React** project using **TypeScript** and **Vite** that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application uses **localStorage** to persist tasks and features **react-toastify** for notifications. The interface is styled using pure CSS.

### Features:
- Add tasks with a unique ID using **nanoid**.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete individual tasks or clear all tasks.
- Persist tasks using **localStorage**.
- Display notifications with **react-toastify**.
- The interface is styled using pure CSS.
