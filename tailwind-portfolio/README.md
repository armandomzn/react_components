## Key Concepts:

### useState
  - `useState` is used to manage task input, the navigation bar state, the window size, and other interactive elements.

### useContext
  - **Context API** is used for state management across multiple components, such as controlling the visibility of the navbar and handling window resizing.

### react-icons
  - Used to display icons representing various technologies in the Skills section, as well as social media links in the Hero section.
